## Template Structure
Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:
```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── components/
│   └── layouts/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
│   └── styles/
└── package.json
```
Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
## Commands
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
| Command                | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
